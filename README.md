git-ftp.py: quick and efficient publishing of Git repositories over FTP
=======================================================================

Introduction
------------

Some web hosts only give you FTP access to the hosting space, but
you would still like to use Git to version the contents of your
directory.  You could upload a full tarball of your website every
time you update but that's wasteful.  git-ftp.py only uploads the
files that changed.

Requirements: [git-python 0.3.x](http://gitorious.org/git-python)
it can be installed with `easy_install gitpython`

We also [have a PPA](https://launchpad.net/~niklas-fiekas/+archive/ppa)
which you can install with `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:niklas-fiekas/ppa`
and then `sudo aptitude install git-ftp`.

Usage: `python git-ftp.py`

Note: If you run git-ftp.py for the first time on an existing project and you
already have files on the FTP server, you can execute
`git ftp -r <revision-on-ftp>` to only upload changes since that revision. That
avoids a full upload of all files, that might be unnecessary. If you are using
another git repository as a proxy, it might be easier to place a `git-rev.txt`
on the server. It should contain the SHA1 of the last commit which is already
present there.

Storing the FTP credentials
---------------------------

You can place FTP credentials in `.git/ftpdata`, as such:

    [master]
    username=me
    password=s00perP4zzw0rd
    hostname=ftp.hostname.com
    remotepath=/htdocs
    ssl=yes

    [staging]
    username=me
    password=s00perP4zzw0rd
    hostname=ftp.hostname.com
    remotepath=/htdocs/staging
    ssl=no

Each section corresponds to a git branch. FTP SSL support needs Python
2.7 or later.

Exluding certain files from uploading
-------------------------------------

Similarly to `.gitignore` you can specify files which you do not wish to upload.
The default file with ignore patterns is `.gitftpignore` in project root directory,
however you can specify your own for every branch in .git/ftpdata:

    [branch]
    ... credentials ...
    gitftpignore=.my_gitftpignore

Used syntax is same as .gitignore's with the exception of overriding patterns,
eg. `**!**some/pattern`, which is not supported
Negations within patterns works as expected.

Using a bare repository as a proxy
----------------------------------

An additional script post-receive is provided to allow a central bare repository
to act as a proxy between the git users and the ftp server.
Pushing on branches that don't have an entry in the `ftpdata` configuration file
will have the default git behavior (`git-ftp.py` doesn't get called).
One advantage is that **users do not get to know the ftp credentials** (perfect for interns).
This is how the workflow looks like:

    User1 --+                          +--> FTP_staging
             \                        /
    User2 -----> Git bare repository -----> FTP_master
             /                        \
    User3 --+                          +--> FTP_dev

This is how the setup looks like (One `ftpdata` configuration file, and a symlink to the update hook):

    root@server:/path-to-repo/repo.git# ls
    HEAD  ORIG_HEAD  branches  config  description  ftpdata  hooks  info  objects  packed-refs  refs
    root@server:/path-to-repo/repo.git# ls hooks -l
    total 0
    lrwxr-xr-x 1 root    root      29 Aug 19 17:17 post-receive -> /path-to-git-ftp/post-receive
